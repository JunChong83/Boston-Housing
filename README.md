# Predicting Boston Housing Prices using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Algorithms

Introduction:
This report examines the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting Boston housing prices. The dataset used contains various housing variables such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways, as well as the target variable, the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars.

Findings:
We evaluated the performance of four different machine learning algorithms: linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting. The random forest algorithm had the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and highest R-squared value, indicating the best performance in predicting Boston housing prices. The decision tree algorithm had the second-best performance, while linear regression and gradient boosting had higher MSEs and lower R-squared values.

Conclusion:
The results suggest that the random forest algorithm may be the best choice for predicting Boston housing prices using machine learning. Further analysis could be conducted to optimize the model, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. This could improve its performance and provide more accurate housing price predictions, which could be valuable for real estate agencies, homeowners, and policy-makers.
